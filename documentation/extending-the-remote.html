<p>All user interaction in UNTV is facilitated by use of an instance of <code>Remote</code>. 
This instance is created in <code>src/untv.coffee</code>. Nearly all components that will 
require any user interaction or input will likely depend upon this &quot;global&quot; 
instance of <code>Remote</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Remote</code> is an <code>EventEmitter</code> and it is through it&#39;s event interface that 
you interact with it.</p>
<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<p>The <code>Remote</code> emits a standardized set of events to help you determine how to 
properly handle user input. These events are caught and handled like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> remote = <span class="keyword">new</span> Remote();
remote.on(<span class="string">"namespace:action"</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
  <span class="comment">// handle event here</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in the example above, events are namespaced to make it clear 
which subset of actions the event belongs to. The namespaces currently include:</p>
<ul>
<li>scroll</li>
<li>go</li>
<li>menu</li>
<li>player</li>
<li>prompt</li>
<li>confirm</li>
<li>alert</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="event-menu-toggle-">Event: &quot;menu:toggle&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates they would like to toggle the 
global menu off or on. This event is automatically handled via the <code>GlobalMenu</code> 
instance and it is rare that you will need to handle it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="event-go-next-">Event: &quot;go:next&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates they would like to proceed to the 
next in a series of options. An example of this usage is it&#39;s use in the 
<code>VirtualKeyboard</code>, where this action triggers showing the &quot;next&quot; keyboard, as 
in cycling through the alphanumeric keyboard to the symbols keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="event-go-back-">Event: &quot;go:back&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates they would like to perform the 
opposite action of <code>go:next</code> <strong>or</strong> they would like to back out of whatever the 
current view may be. To cite the <code>VirtualKeyboard</code> class again, this is used to 
hide the keyboard and return to the previous state.</p>
<h3 id="event-go-select-">Event: &quot;go:select&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates a selection of whatver the current 
focused item is. This is used to select a menu item, play a movie, and similar.</p>
<h3 id="event-scroll-up-">Event: &quot;scroll:up&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates they wish to move focus to an item 
above the current focused item.</p>
<h3 id="event-scroll-down-">Event: &quot;scroll:down&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates they wish to move focus to an item 
below the current focused item.</p>
<h3 id="event-scroll-left-">Event: &quot;scroll:left&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates they wish to move focus to an item 
left of the current focused item.</p>
<h3 id="event-scroll-right-">Event: &quot;scroll:right&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired when the user indicates they wish to move focus to an item 
right of the current focused item.</p>
<h3 id="event-player-toggle-">Event: &quot;player:toggle&quot;</h3>
<p>This event fires when the user wishes to pause/play the currently playing 
media. This is handled automatically in the global <code>Player</code> instance.</p>
<h3 id="event-player-next-">Event: &quot;player:next&quot;</h3>
<p>This event fires when the user wishes to skip ahead in the currently playing 
media. This is handled automatically in the global <code>Player</code> instance.</p>
<h3 id="event-player-prev-">Event: &quot;player:prev&quot;</h3>
<p>This event fires when the user wishes to skip back in the the currently playing 
media. This is handled automatically in the global <code>Player</code> instance.</p>
<h3 id="event-player-seek-">Event: &quot;player:seek&quot;</h3>
<p>This event fires when the user wishes to specify the time in the currently 
playing media. This is handled automatically in the global <code>Player</code> instance.</p>
<h3 id="event-prompt-answer-">Event: &quot;prompt:answer&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired as a response to a <code>remote.sockets.emit(&quot;prompt:ask&quot;)</code> 
event sent to the Remote Interface (smartphone) and contains text data.</p>
<h3 id="event-confirm-answer-">Event: &quot;confirm:answer&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired as a response to a <code>remote.sockets.emit(&quot;confirm:ask&quot;)</code> 
event sent to the Remote Interface (smartphone) and contains boolean data.</p>
<h3 id="event-alert-dismissed-">Event: &quot;alert:dismissed&quot;</h3>
<p>This event is fired as a response to a <code>remote.sockets.emit(&quot;alert:show&quot;)</code> 
event sent to the Remote Interface (smartphone).</p>
<h2 id="remote-interface-smartphone-">Remote Interface (Smartphone)</h2>
<p>The UNTV <code>Remote</code> class is instantiated with a single argument which defines 
the port on which the instance will serve the smartphone interface. If the 
<code>Remote</code> is instantiated without this parameter it will default to <code>8080</code>.</p>
<p>This starts a web server that is accessible via the host machine&#39;s IP address 
and port, when your phone is connected to the same local network.</p>
<p>When the interface is accessed via HTTP (using your phone&#39;s web browser), it 
opens a socket connection back to the host machine to transmit events receieved 
from the user (you), back to the originating <code>Remote</code> instance. These events 
are essentially proxied through the <code>Remote</code> instance after filtering out any 
non-standard events and since <code>Remote</code> is an <code>EventEmitter</code>, it simply emits 
the same events back to the UNTV application, where they are handled by the 
different interface components.</p>
<p>Since using a smartphone buys us some functionality we would otherwise not have 
using an IR remote or otherwise, the Remote Interface supports a few events 
UNTV can actually send to <strong>it</strong>.</p>
<p>This can be done by emitting an event from the application back to the 
<code>sockets</code> object tied to the <code>Remote</code> instance:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> remote = <span class="keyword">new</span> Remote(<span class="number">8080</span>)
<span class="comment">// send alert to phone</span>
remote.sockets.emit(<span class="string">"alert:show"</span>, {
  message: <span class="string">"Hello, Remote Interface!"</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>All of these events should pass an object where <code>message</code> is a string that 
should indicate to the user, what action should be taken if any.</p>
<h3 id="event-alert-show-">Event: &quot;alert:show&quot;</h3>
<p>Shows a notification on the remote interface similar to a traditional <code>alert</code>, 
and emits an &quot;alert:dismissed&quot; event back to the <code>Remote</code>, when the alert is 
dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="event-prompt-ask-">Event: &quot;prompt:ask&quot;</h3>
<p>Shows a text prompt on the remote interface similar to a traditional <code>prompt</code>, 
and emits a &quot;prompt:answer&quot; event back to the <code>Remote</code>, passing along the value 
the user entered into the prompt.</p>
<h3 id="event-confirm-ask-">Event: &quot;confirm:ask&quot;</h3>
<p>Shows a confirmation popup on the remote interface similar to a traditional 
<code>confirm</code>, and emits a &quot;confirm:answer&quot; event back to the <code>Remote</code>, passing 
along a boolean value indicating whether or not the user confirmed.</p>
